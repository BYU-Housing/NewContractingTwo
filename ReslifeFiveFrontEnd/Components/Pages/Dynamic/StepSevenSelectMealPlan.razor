    <li>True Blue Dining is available to all students, except for residents of Helaman Halls.</li>
    <li>True Blue Dining may be used at any Dining Services locations, excluding Concessions and Campus Floral.</li>
    <li>
        Holders are exempt from delivery fees associated with orders placed with CougarDash and Meals To-go when placing orders
        using dining dollars.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dining Dollar balance is accessible during the Christmas break for those with Fall-Winter agreements. The weekly allotments
        (if they choose a weekly allotment) do not occur over Christmas break. The Cannon Commons does not maintain regular
        hours during the break and may close during a portion of the break.
    </li>
    <li>
        Additional blocks of 55 Dining Dollars may be added for $50. These blocks can be added via My Dining Account but must be
        paid for in My Financial Center.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dining Dollars at the end of Fall semester will roll over to the Dining Dollars portion of the student’s Winter semester meal plan
        with an accrual limit of $200, if they are contracted with a rollover qualified meal plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dining Dollars remaining at the end of the agreement period or when granted a change in meal plans, up to $200, will be added
        to the Dining Dollars portion of a new plan, (with the exception of the EZ Dining plan) if the student enrolls in a rollover qualified
        meal plan. Rollover from meal plans may apply until the student’s graduation from BYU.
    </li>
    <li>
        Plans purchased for semesters and terms PRIOR to Fall 2024 are exempt from rollover accrual limits, holders may roll the full
        amount of funds from these plans into any rollover qualified plan. After rollover into a new plan, any further rollover is limited
        to the $200 accrual limit for future plans.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a meal plan holder fails to enroll in a new meal plan, any unused Dining Dollars will be forfeited at 11:59 p.m. on the last
        day of the agreement period.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the plan holder begins or is released from their agreement on any day except those listed as official start and end dates,
        all charges and Dining Dollar allotment will be prorated.
    </li>
    <li>
        A plan holder living on campus may be released from their meal plan only if released from their on-campus housing agreement.
        If released from their on-campus housing agreement, the meal plan charge will be pro-rated based upon the last day of the
        housing agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
        A plan holder living off campus may be released from their meal plan only upon discontinuance/graduation from the university.
        If released, the meal plan charge will be pro-rated based upon the discontinuance/graduation date.
    </li>
    <li>Until the add/drop deadline for classes each semester, any requests for meal plan changes or cancellations from students will be automatically approved.</li>
    <li>
        For changes or cancellations after the add/drop deadline, students must submit petitions which are subject to review.
    </li>
    <li>
        If, during fall or winter semesters, a student moves to Helaman Halls, they must select from the Dining Plus or Open Door
        meal plans. If a student moves during spring or summer terms to Helaman Halls, they must select the Dining Plus meal plan.
        The meal plan charge will be prorated for any student with a meal plan who moves to Helaman Halls. If a meal plan holder
        uses more than the pro-rated amount, then they will be charged for the amount used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meal plan holders may petition to discontinue/change their meal plan at any time. Petitions are subject to review by the Meal
        Plan Review Board on an individual basis. It is understood that if their petition to discontinue is granted, the meal plan holder
        will forfeit:
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Any accumulated Dining Dollar rollover from previous semesters.</li>
        <li>Any current Dining Dollar accrual from the current agreement period.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Additionally, if the meal plan holder is released from the meal plan agreement, the meal plan charge will be pro-rated based
        upon the length of time remaining in the agreement.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the plan holder begins or is released from their agreement on any day except those listed as official start and end dates,
        all charges and Dining Dollar allotment will be prorated.
    </li>
    <li>
        If a plan holder is released from the meal plan during the agreement period, any unused Dining Dollars will be forfeited at
        11:59 p.m. on the release date.
    </li>
    <li>For those who choose a weekly allotment:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Plan holders receive the allotment on the first day of the agreement at 12:01AM and on every Monday thereafter of the
            agreement period, except the week of Thanksgiving and the last week of Spring term.
